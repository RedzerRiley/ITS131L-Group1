# ITS131LGroup1
Create two SQL scripts: CREATE TABLE statements that have the necessary integrity constraints including primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints, etc. Start the script with a set of “Drop Table” statements. Use the names of tables as well as the names of attributes exactly as presented in the ERD. Include at least four useful check constraints (not the “Not Null” or “Unique” constraints).

INSERT statements containing at least 10 rows of logical data per table. You may need to add more rows for some tables to help make sense of the relationships.

Create two VIEWS, two STORED PROCEDURES, and one TRIGGER. Make sure that their uses make sense in the business environment. Store them in separate files.

Use Oracle SQL in creating the scripts.

Make sure that there will be no errors when the files are run. Combine all seven files in a zip file using your team name. (e.g. Philippines.zip). Other compressed file types like rar will not be accepted.

You will present through video (at most 20 minutes) discussing how you implemented the database and the results of running the scripts. Imagine that you are presenting to the client the final output of your deliverables.

Create a folder in one of the member's Mapua OneDrive that contains the zipped file and the presentation video.

Important: Make sure all statements are working as intended.
